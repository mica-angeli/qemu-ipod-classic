/*
 * S5L8702 I2S transmitter, 0x3CA00000.
 *
 * See include/hw/arm/ipod_classic/ipod_classic_i2s.h for the register map and
 * wiki/14-classic6g-audio.md for the whole audio path and how it was measured.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODEL DOES
 *
 *  - A register file with honest readback. The retailOS writes CLKCON=1,
 *    TXCON=0x0b100019, TXCOM=0x6 (start), RXCON=0x1000, CLKDIV=272 and reads
 *    I2STXCOM back to confirm the transmitter started; while this block was
 *    create_unimplemented_device every one of those readbacks was zero.
 *
 *  - A TX FIFO sink at +0x10. DMAC0 (a PL080) streams 16-bit PCM samples here.
 *    While the block was unimplemented ~6144 samples per boot fell to the floor.
 *
 *  - PCM capture. With AUDIOWAV=/path.wav set, every sample written to the FIFO
 *    is appended to a 16-bit-stereo WAV whose sample rate is taken from CLKDIV.
 *    That WAV is the hito-3 artefact.
 *
 *  - Pacing (hito 2), when armed. See ipod_classic_i2s_drain(): the FIFO is
 *    drained at the sample rate by a QEMUTimer that gates DMAC0's request line,
 *    so the PL080 hands over one burst at a time and its terminal-count IRQ (16)
 *    reaches the firmware at real playback tempo instead of all at once. This is
 *    what makes the Now Playing progress bar advance with the clock.
 *
 * INSTRUMENTATION: I2STRACE=1 prints every access with its value and guest PC,
 * same pattern as DISPTRACE=1/ATATRACE=1. Independently of the trace, the FIRST
 * non-zero PCM sample of a run is announced on stderr -- that is the event the
 * whole audio investigation waited for.

 *      that transition, its timer never starts, and not one sample is clocked
 *      out (the wav backend then holds a 44-byte header; pa stays silent).
 *  (2) Push with AUD_write from the write path (i2s_live_sample) and from the
 *      out callback; AUD_write takes only what the mixer can hold now, the rest
