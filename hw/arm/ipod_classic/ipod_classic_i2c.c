 * CLOSING A TRANSFER, and why it needs its own flag.

 * has just written, and a STOP is exactly the write that clears it (0xd0 and
 * 0x90 against 0xf0 and 0xb0 for a START) -- so the test was never true and no
 * transfer was ever ended.
 *
 * That matters more than it sounds, because QEMU's I2C core treats a START on
 * a bus that still has a transfer open as a REPEATED start to the same slave
 * and does not look at the address. MEASURED with I2CTRACE=1 on firmware
 * 2.0.5: from the first PMU access of the boot onwards, every transaction was
 * delivered to the PMU, whatever it was addressed to --
 *
 *     I2C wr 0x4a ack        74 at boot, the codec's whole bring-up
 *     I2C wr 0x39 ack        17, to an address with no model behind it at all
 *
 * and the codec model next door, written precisely so that those writes would
 * stop being NACKed, never received one byte (CODECTRACE=1: 0 register writes
 * in a run that started playback and moved the volume). The codec's registers
 * were being written into the PMU's instead.
 *
 * A real repeated START does re-address the bus, so one to a DIFFERENT slave
 * closes the transfer here first; to the same slave it is left open, which is
 * the register-pointer-then-read idiom both chips rely on.
